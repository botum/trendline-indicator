# How?

In this approach we are dealing with little information about 1000 tikers.
At first I do not expect good results from this but it is interesting to try.

# To do

* Paramters:
  * tolerance: Tolerance for difference tolerable for points
  * confirmations:  how many low/high where exactly in the sup/res trend respectively.
  * slope_min: minimal angle of valid trendlines
  * slope_max: maximum angle of valid trendlines
  * Log scale option
